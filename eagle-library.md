# Eagle Library

While working on my home automation project, I've had to
create a library of devices for Eagle. The library can be
found in [my repository](http://gstein.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/eagle/).


## Parts

Look in the library for the latest parts, but I'll try to
keep this page updated for a little Google love when
people are trying to find a part.
